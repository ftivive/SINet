# SINet
## Description
We introduce a novel network architecture and processing unit, referred to as the shunting inhibitory neuron, for crowd counting. This architecture is structured into encoder and decoder modules, where the latter is characterized by a sequence of alternating convolutional and transformer layers. This design captures rich contextual information that is used for generating accurate segmentation and density maps. The shunting inhibitory neuron, which can generate complex decision boundaries, is more powerful than the traditional perceptron.
